Hi people! I'm Kristel. I am currently 19 years old, and I am a sophomore majoring in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 2023.

As you can probably tell, I like drawing. I started bullet journalling my second semester of senior year, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I bought a Moleskine notebook but I really regret that decision because their paper is thinner than rice paper and the ink ghosts badly. I do not recommend. All my drawings on this site were done on scrap paper, taken a photo of then traced over in Adobe Illustrator. Which is kind of a lot of work, but I enjoy it and I had a lot of free time this summer.

I mostly do front-end work, but I can design as well. Be sure to hit up my email if you want to get in touch, I don't really check LinkedIn because I get a lot of spam there.

And for anyone that is curious, this site was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (code here on [Github](https://github.com/kristelfung/bullet-journal)). I am using [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to manage my content - I highly recommend it, it was very easy to configure.
