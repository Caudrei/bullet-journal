I am off to college soon, leaving August 23. With all this extra time in the summer (since I did not get a job this year), I decided it would be an excellent opportunity to learn how to cook, because I did not want to destroy my body with cup noodles in freshman year. 

Something I really wanted to learn how to make was chocolate chip cookies. Not that I would be eating cookies everyday of course, but I decided it would be a good start. The first time I created them this summer was last Saturday at 2:00 AM, but they all turned out hard as rocks. I almost threw all of them away but instead I made my dad eat them. After this, I embarked on my journey to create the perfect chocolate chip cookie. I decided to use a modified version of Tasty’s “The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies” (I used less granulated sugar).

I walked into the kitchen only to see my brother SUBMERGING A RAW FROZEN STEAK INTO WARM WATER WITHOUT ANY PLASTIC PACKAGING...I was horrified and I almost screamed out loud. I am no professional, but having watched an entire season of Masterchef I am pretty sure you aren’t supposed to waterlog your steaks before frying them. Anyway…none of my business.

I set to work using this recipe: 

* 165g soft brown sugar
* 70g granulated white sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 100g melted unsalted butter (1/2 cup)
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 155g all purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 220g semi sweet milk chocolate chips

First mix all the sugars, salt, melted butter, egg and vanilla extract. Then sift in the flour and baking soda, mix until you get your dough BUT DO NOT OVERMIX BECAUSE APPARENTLY THIS MAKES THE COOKIES HARD. Then add chocolate chips and refrigerate for at least an hour. Scoop into balls on a baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes (I used an ice cream scooper). When you take them out of the oven, let it rest for 5 minutes, they might be a little soft but that is ok, the heat from the pan and cookies will cook it through. They turned out quite nice. I like to eat cookies fresh so I just leave the dough in the fridge for a few days and bake the cookies when I feel like eating them.

Also, I think this will be the last time I make so many images for a blog post because these took ages to draw.
